    <h4>Redesigning a local frozen yogurt store's website</h4>
    <br>
    <h2>Introducing Berryline</h2>

    BerryLine is a local frozen yogurt and ice cream shop in Cambridge, MA. They have two locations, one in Harvard
    Square and one in Porter Square. Their website is a place for customers to find location hours and addresses, the
    products they offer, job opportunities, and a variety of other information. They briefly describe the flavors they
    have on sale and the other types of desserts and drinks that they serve.

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">The original Berryline website</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br>
    <h2>Identifying Problems</h2>
    At first glance, the BerryLine website appears to be clean and simple. However, upon further exploration, it becomes
    apparent that there is a ton of information, and that much of it is not easily accessible. The design flaws become
    even more apparent when evaluating the website in terms of the government’s usability criteria.
    <br>
    <h5>Intuitive Design</h5>
    The navigation bar is usable, but the page names are not very helpful in indicating the information that can be
    found on each page. For example, the “HOME” page contains a plethora of information, including current flavors, an
    “About Us” section, a menu and more. The overwhelming amount of information on a single page makes it difficult for
    users to find what they need.

    The location pages display the location, address and hours. The map is located two sections after the address is
    actually listed. It’s position so far down makes it not immediately helpful to the user. The color blocking on the
    page gives the sense that the webpage ends earlier than it does. Additionally, each location page contains a history
    of the location. However, it hidden at the bottom of the page, after a “Contact” section, which usually is placed at
    the bottom of webpages.

    Also, the visibility of system status isn’t great. The user has no idea that the flavors of the yogurt change on a
    weekly basis and when they update.

    <br>
    <h5>Ease of Learning</h5>
    The website is more difficult to learn that it should be. As an example, a new user would likely have trouble
    locating a menu as there is no menu tab. The option to buy a gift card is not very easy to find as it is at the very
    bottom of the “HOME” tab.

    A new user also might want to learn more about the product from a nutritional perspective. Is it vegan? Are there
    dairy-free options? However, the yogurt information page is hidden in a link labeled “More Information” under the
    yogurt item on the menu on the “HOME” tab.
    <br>
    <h5>Efficiency of Use and Memorability </h5>
    The website’s small size makes it easy to navigate the pages quickly. However, the confusing layout and the links
    scattered around the website make it difficult for people to navigate and find what is needed, leading to needless
    searching around and decreasing memorability. Additionally, there’s too much white space. It makes everything very
    far apart and not efficient to use.The website is memorable to a certain extent, but the lack of intuitive design
    hinders that process. It is difficult to use recognition rather than recall on this website.

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Wireframing</h2>
    After finding so many issues, we wanted to redesign the BerryLine website to improve its usability.

    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <img class="wireframe" src="main-wireframe.png">
            <img class="wireframe" src="menu.png">
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            We started by creating wireframes for the “Home” page, the “Locations” page, the “Menu” page, the “Contact”
            page, and the “Our Story” page. Note that one of the most significant changes we made was in redesigning the
            pages found on the
            navigation bar.

        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <img class="wireframe" src="contact.png">
            <img class="wireframe" src="location.png">
            <img class="wireframe" src="whoweare.png">

        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Visual Redesign</h2>
    Next, we took two of our wireframes and made them into high-fidelity interfaces to demonstrate
    what the website should look like in production.

    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <img class="wireframe" src="hifi-home.png">
        </div>
        <div class="column">

            <img class="wireframe" src="hifi-location.png">

            <strong>On the left in the home page</strong>, colors from the logo are used as accent colors throughout the
            page to keep the
            color palette consistent. They also provide contrast against the white background.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lettering on the images shows the user exactly what flavor they are looking at. We have added a translucent
            box on top of each image to make the text is readable, varying opacity to account for the colour under it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Using uniform pictures instead of simply displaying the flavor names provides continuity on the page.
            Further, the textures of the close up ice cream shots add a component beyond color.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>In the location page above</strong>, we removed the bright red color
            blocking for a subtle blue color.
            This gives a nice transition while
            adding fullness to the page.
            In the navigation bar, location is
            highlighted red, letting the user
            know where they are. The
            directions button is in the logo’s
            red shade to draw the users eye
            to it.

        </div>
    </div>
